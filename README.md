# MedImg-Assignment

Generate a 1000 two-dimensional dataset, X that is of two classes and plot. The 1st 500 data vectors are modeled by the Gaussian distribution with mean, m1 = [-8, 8] T and the rest 500 data vectors are modeled by the Gaussian distribution with mean m2 = [-8, 8] T . The covariance matrix for both distributions are T S = [0.3 1.5 1.5 9.0 ] Use the same prescription to generate another data 200 and create a test dataset X .
